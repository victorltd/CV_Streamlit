The primary objective was to identify patterns, critical accident-prone locations, and common contributing factors (e.g., types of accidents, causes, conditions of victims, vehicle types involved, and temporal trends). By processing and visualizing this data, the project aimed to provide actionable insights that could contribute to public awareness campaigns, support data-driven decision-making for road safety interventions, and potentially guide infrastructure improvements.",
